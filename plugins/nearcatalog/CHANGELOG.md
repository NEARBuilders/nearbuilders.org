# @everything-dev/nearcatalog-plugin

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c801c40: Complete the reviewed NEAR Catalog claim lifecycle and public presentation for issues #54 and #55.

  - Derive manual activity identity from authentication, add trusted admin-only activity emission, make emitted events idempotent, and support hiding revoked activity from feeds and leaderboards.
  - Apply approved Catalog claims through a compensating workflow that verifies current builder and Catalog state, records a verified activity snapshot, and safely retries or rolls back partial failures.
  - Support rejected and removed claim resubmissions while preserving proposal history, and expose complete claim review, retry, rejection, and revocation controls to administrators.
  - Present claimed Catalog contributions on builder profiles, render specialized claim activity, and merge current Catalog projects into the public and personal project directories without duplicating local projects.

- c801c40: Add the NEAR Catalog project adapter and reviewed contribution claim foundation (#52).

  - **nearcatalog plugin**: Normalize active projects from the NEAR Catalog API, persist one active claim per builder and project with multiple roles, and expose public reads plus admin-only claim lifecycle operations.
  - **api**: Expose public project search, project detail, claim listing, and claimed-project aggregation routes backed by the NEAR Catalog plugin.

### Patch Changes

- c801c40: Add the approved-builder NEAR Catalog contribution proposal flow.

  - Keep Catalog proposals private to their submitter and administrators across proposal lists, counts, audit logs, and event streams.
  - Add authenticated Catalog claim proposal submission and current-builder status APIs with server-derived claimant identity, active-project validation, normalized roles, idempotent retries, and rejected-only revisions.
  - Resolve linked NEAR identity from the auth context so notification reads and streams remain authenticated.
  - Accept array-shaped Catalog tags and isolate malformed search entries without converting valid empty results into upstream errors.
  - Add URL-backed manual activity and project contribution tabs with Project contribution as the approved-builder default, Catalog project search and preview, multi-role submission, proposal status cards, rejected-proposal editing, and an owner-only builder profile CTA.
